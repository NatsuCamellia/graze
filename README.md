# Graze

**Let your livestock find their own food and reproduce naturally.**

## Features

## How to Play

Simply plant the corresponding crops near your animals and they will automatically approach, eat, and breed on their own.

Works great alongside automated farms for a fully self-sustaining livestock system!
